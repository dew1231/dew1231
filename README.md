# Hey, I am Ahtesham. I am a second year Student in Mumbai, pursuing Computer Science and Engineering (Cyber Security).
- I really like reverse engineering applications. This curiosity of how something works because of 1s and 0s has led to this path in life and I am glad to be here.

- Using and developing open source projects (FOSS) is amazing and I hope to contribute more to it.

- My major interest would be in CyberSecurity itself but I would like to puruse DevSecOps or Cloud Security as a career option.

- I use a T480 with Arch i3-wm with a secondary ssd with Win11 for games.

## Iâ€™m currently learning :

- Rust, C#, Assembly for Reverse Engineering
- TensorFlow and Kubernetes Clusters
- React Native, Three.js, Next.Js
- Server Management and Google Cloud Services
- DevSecOps

I am exploring the domain right now soo i would contribute to anything I find interesting.
